        <p class="indent">I am a 25 year old female entreprenuer and small business owner, currently studying business at Brigham Young University. I was born and raised in Northern Utah as the youngest of six children. I have three older brothers, two older sisters, and the best parents in the world. We love spending time together. I got married last year to Roy Kohler and I love spending time and learning new hobbies with him. I am the co-founder of Everyday Kids, along with my sister in law, Paige. Everyday Kids is a children's clothing brand with an important mission to inspire children to be their best everyday, by being kind and confident. I have a passion for all things business and marketing. I love learning new things and getting out of my comfort zone. Read more of my favorite things to do on the "More" tab.  </p>
